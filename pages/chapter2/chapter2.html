    <h1>Unexpected Discontinuities</h1>
    <h2>Wait, what is a discontinuity?</h2>
    <p>Generally speaking, when you hear a click in your audio, that's a "discontinuity". We inherited the word from mathmaticians which is why it's such a mouthful. In audio we usually just call them clicks, but it's helpful to know the word discontinuity because it also sort of explains what it is.</p>
    <p><i>This ties back into envelopes I swear</i></p>
    <p>A discontinuity is a place where the audio wave isn't continuous (basically when it's not smooth). Here is an example (discontinuities are notated with the little blue arrows)</p>

    <div id="discont_01-container"></div>

    <p>Click the image to see a new discontinuity</p>
    <h2>Why does this happen?</h2>
    <p>A discontinuity (an audible click) happens whenever the amplitude of the wave changes abruptly. The bigger the change in amplitude, the louder the click. You can also see now why it's called a <b>discontinuity</b>, it's a visible cut in the smooth shape of the wave which makes the wave <b>not continuous</b></p>
    <h3>What does this have to do with envelopes?</h3>
    <p>Envelopes can create discontinuities in your sound (as you've probably heard before if you've ever tried to use Operator in Ableton to make your sub bass). Sine waves with a sharp amp env are the easiest place to catch this happening, but it is also happening in other wave shapes (but the sound can be masked by the other frequencies that wave is making/contains)</p>
